# Doctor Docs

Doctor Docs is an electronic health record service, created to reduce cost and accelerate information exchange.

By reducing double counting of diseases, doctor's offices can focus on what they really want to do, help people!
But not only do they have **more time to care about you**, they can do their work more cost-efficient. As they get paid
by
your health insurance, and you pay the health insurance, you can help **lowering your monthly contribution** by using
Doctor Docs!

Living on the countryside, struggling to find a doctor at all? Doctor Docs is here to help you!  
Many doctors can not make a living on the countryside, because of the way they get paid by health insurances.
And another time, the cost efficiency of Doctor Docs comes in handy. Doctor Docs will enable your Doctor to easily
access your hospital, or specialist documents, as you can share those documents with your doctor, as soon as you receive
them through doctor docs.  
Haven't got your documents through Doctor Docs? No problem, we got your back!  
Simply **upload** them yourself and **share** them with all the doctors you want.

Changing doctors has never been easier!  
Doctor Docs allows you to change your doctor by replacing all shares with your previous doctor with your new ony by one
click.

Documents are outdated?  
Easy one. Just delete them and no doctor will ever be confused by outdated documents anymore.

## Build instructions

The project was created with the `npx create-react-app client --typescript` command.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project, so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
